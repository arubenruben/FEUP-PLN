# Argumentative Discourse Units Classification

This repository stores the code developed during the NLP course at FEUP. It is divided into project 1 and project 2, which target the same objective and **address a classification task over Portugues argumentative text.** The first part uses only classical machine learning techniques. The second part uses hugging face transformers to address this problem.

## What is an ADU?

Text spans that are taken to have an argumentative role (either as premises or conclusions of arguments). There are 5 possible labels in this multi-class classification problem. Value, Value(+), Value(-), Fact, or Policy.

## What is the Dataset used?
This project was an appendix to the DARGMINTS project whose teaching staff is an active part of it. It uses news from the Portuguese newspaper Público.

## Final Results
The first approach performed better but was tougher to achieve, transformers provided a straightforward approach to this problem but were harder to manage.
